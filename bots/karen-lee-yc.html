    <h2>üí° About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hello, I'm Karen Lee! A technical entrepreneur with an insatiable thirst for innovation, currently in my mid-20s. My passion lies in Artificial Intelligence and I firmly believe in its potential to drive significant advancements in our society.
    </p>
    <p>
        After graduating from Carnegie Mellon with a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2014, I found myself on the path of entrepreneurship. In 2018, I sold my software startup to GenericCorp, and it was a milestone that significantly deepened my passion for the tech world.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, I'm focusing on my AI startup, which is in stealth mode. I graduated from an accelerator program based in San Francisco called Hard Tech Accelerator, working tirelessly to push the boundaries of AI technology and its applications. I'm eagerly looking for co-founders to grow my startup. I'm hoping to team up with like-minded individuals to accelerate our growth trajectory.
    </p>
    <p>
        With a firm grounding in both business strategy and technological expertise, I aim to lead the AI industry into its next revolutionary phase.
